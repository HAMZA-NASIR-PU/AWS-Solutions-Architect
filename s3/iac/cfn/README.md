# AWS CloudFormation Deployment

This folder contains three files related to AWS CloudFormation for deploying, managing, and deleting an S3 bucket using a CloudFormation template.

## Files
1. **template.yaml**: 
   This is the CloudFormation template used to create a simple S3 bucket. The S3 bucket's name will be auto-generated by AWS.

2. **deploy**: 
   This file contains a bash script to deploy the CloudFormation stack using the template file. It uses the AWS CLI to create or update the stack in the specified region.

3. **delete-stack**: 
   This file contains a bash script to delete the CloudFormation stack. It will remove all resources that were provisioned by the template.

## AWS CloudFormation Terminologies

### 1. Stack
A stack is a collection of AWS resources that can be managed as a single unit. You can create, update, and delete stacks using CloudFormation templates.

### 2. Template
A template is a JSON or YAML formatted text file that describes the AWS resources that CloudFormation will provision. Each template defines the resources and their configurations.

### 3. Resources
Resources are the AWS entities that you define in your CloudFormation template, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS databases.

### 4. Change Set
A change set is a preview of the changes that CloudFormation will apply to your stack when you update it. You can review these changes before executing them.

### 5. Parameters
Parameters allow you to input custom values into your template at runtime, providing flexibility and reusability for different environments.

### 6. Outputs
Outputs are used to declare values you want to be able to access after your stack is created, such as resource IDs or URLs.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials.
2. Run the `deploy` script to deploy the CloudFormation stack.
3. Once the resources are no longer needed, run the `delete-stack` script to clean up the provisioned resources.
